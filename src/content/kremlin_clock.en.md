The Moscow Kremlin is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as a masterpiece of human genius. One of the most recognizable elements of the Kremlin – the clock on the Spasskaya Tower is known not only for its deep history but also for its legendary accuracy.

These qualities made the Kremlin clock a festive attribute of the New Year. Citizens of the USSR met midnight to the chimes. Traditionally, a New Year's wish had to be made during the striking of the clock. The twelfth beat of the bell heralded a new year.

This app is a digital tribute to the legendary clock. It shows a stylized analog clock face with a second hand.

The time displayed by the app is always accurate, close to the atomic clock to hundredths of a second. This is achieved by Network Time Protocol (NTP) synchronization. To keep the time accurate, please make sure that your internet connection is active.

A special New Year mode allows you to celebrate the New Year with the clock striking. Unlike real chimes, the striking of the clock begins exactly one minute before midnight, and the twelfth stroke really coincides with the beginning of the new year
