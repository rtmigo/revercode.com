The time displayed by the app is always accurate, close to the atomic clock to hundredths of a second. This is achieved by Network Time Protocol (NTP) synchronization. To keep the time accurate, please make sure that your internet connection is active.

A special New Year mode allows you to celebrate the New Year with the clock striking. In New Year mode the striking begins one minute before midnight, and the twelfth stroke exactly coincides with the beginning of the new year
